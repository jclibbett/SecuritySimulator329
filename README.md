About
Welcome to the simulation. In which you have been hired to work for a company as a member on the security team. Your job is to protect the company's data. Throughout the simulation, random events or questions will appear and you will attempt to choose the best option. Incorrect answers will increase the threat on your threat bar similar to a health bar. This is found on the bottom of your screen once you start. The goal is to keep the threat low. If you make unsafe choices and the threat gets high enough the game ends. Not every question might be completely wrong, but there will be a best solution. After each question or event you will receive feedback about the question. It will explain the pros and cons of each choice. Keep our company safe!


Please run SecuritySimulator.exe to play the game.
